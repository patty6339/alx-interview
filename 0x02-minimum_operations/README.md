Dynamic Programming:
Dynamic programming is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down complex problems into simpler, overlapping subproblems. Solutions to these subproblems are stored and reused to avoid redundant calculations, which leads to optimized results. It’s particularly useful in problems that exhibit optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, like the “Minimum Operations” problem.

Prime Factorization:
Prime factorization is the process of expressing a number as a product of its prime factors. It helps in simplifying many mathematical problems, including those where the goal is to work with the factors of a number, like finding the sum of the prime factors of a given number.

Code Optimization:
Code optimization focuses on improving the efficiency of code by minimizing resource usage (e.g., time or memory). This involves refining algorithms, eliminating redundant operations, and optimizing data structures. Optimized code ensures that solutions run faster and more efficiently.

Greedy Algorithms:
Greedy algorithms make decisions step by step, choosing the best immediate option without considering the larger problem. They are often simpler than dynamic programming but may not always lead to the globally optimal solution. They can still be effective in problems where the local optimum leads to a global optimum.

Basic Python Programming:
Strong proficiency in Python, including the use of loops, conditionals, and functions, is essential for implementing algorithms. Familiarity with Python functions helps in structuring code efficiently and solving problems with greater clarity and modularity.

By mastering these concepts, you'll be well-prepared to solve problems efficiently, especially when dealing with complex algorithms like those required in dynamic programming or greedy approaches.
